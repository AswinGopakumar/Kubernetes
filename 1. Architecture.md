#  Kubernetes Components

## Control plane components

- **API Server**: 
	- The API server is like a front end of the control plane. 
	- All the external and internal components communicate with the API server.
- **Controller Manager**:
	- Runs various controllers that regulate the cluster state.
	- **Types of controllers**:
	    - **Node Controller**: Detects and responds when nodes go down.
	    - **Replication Controller**: Maintains desired number of pod replicas.
- **etcd**:
	- A distributed key-value store to store all cluster state data (configurations, secrets, node states, etc.).
- **cloud-controller-manager**:
	- Interacts with cloud provider APIs
- **Scheduler**:
	- Assigns newly created pods to suitable nodes based on resource availability, constraints (like affinity/anti-affinity rules), and policies.
	- It **doesn't** actually run pods â€” it just decides **where** they should run.

## API Server Request Lifecycle

When a direct API POST request is made to create a pod, the API Server:

1. Authenticates and validates the request.
2. Constructs a pod object (initially without a node assignment) and updates the etcd store.
3. Notifies the requester that the pod has been created.

For instance, using a curl command:

```
curl -X POST /api/v1/namespaces/default/pods ...[other]
Pod created!
```

The scheduler continuously monitors the API Server for pods that need node assignments. Once a new pod is detected, the scheduler selects an appropriate node and informs the API Server. The API Server then updates the etcd datastore with the new assignment and passes this information to the Kubelet on the worker node. The Kubelet deploys the pod via the container runtime and later updates the pod status back to the API Server for synchronization with etcd.

## Node components

- **kubelet**:
	- Ensures that the pods are running
- **Container runtime**:
	- It is the software that runs containers (e.g., containerd, CRI-O, Docker).
- **kube-proxy**:
	- Manages network rules and implements IP addresses and ports for services.
	- Provides basic load balancing by routing traffic to appropriate pod instances.
- **Pods**:
	- Smallest deployable unit in kubernetes.
	- Contains definition of how to run a container in form of a yaml file.
