# Kubernetes Learning Notes – Day 2

## 🧱 Core Concepts

### Pods
- The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
- Encapsulates one or more containers, shared storage/network, and a specification for how to run the containers.

### Nodes
- A Node is a worker machine in Kubernetes.
- It may be a VM or a physical machine.
- Each node contains the necessary services to run Pods and is managed by the Control Plane.

### Clusters
- A cluster is a set of nodes that run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes.

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

### kubectl
- Command-line tool to interact with Kubernetes clusters.
- Used to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources.

### minikube
- A tool that runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally.
- Great for learning and testing purposes.

---

## 📦 Basic Commands Used

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```
- Lists all nodes in the cluster.

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
- Lists all pods in the current namespace.

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```
- Shows additional details (e.g., IPs, node name) for each pod.

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```
- Displays detailed information about a specific pod, including events and status.

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```
- Retrieves logs from the pod's main container.

## 🚀 Deployment Exercise

- Deployed a basic Nginx pod using the official example:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: nginx
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:1.14.2
      ports:
      - containerPort: 80
  ```

- Verified deployment with:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

---

## 🛠️ Interacting with the Cluster

- SSH’ed into the Minikube VM:
  ```bash
  minikube ssh
  ```

- Used `curl` inside Minikube to check the Nginx pod's internal IP:
  ```bash
  curl <nginx-pod-ip>
  ```

---

## ✅ Summary

- Learned key Kubernetes concepts: Pods, Nodes, Clusters.
- Got hands-on experience using Minikube and kubectl.
- Successfully deployed and interacted with a running container inside Kubernetes.
