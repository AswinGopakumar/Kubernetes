# Kubernetes Learning Notes – Day 3

## 🧱 Key Concepts

### Containers vs Pods vs Deployments

- **Containers**:
  - Lightweight, standalone, executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software.
  - Runs a single process typically.

- **Pods**:
  - Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes that can host one or more containers.
  - Containers in a pod share network and storage.
  - Useful pattern: **Sidecar containers** (e.g., for logging, monitoring).

- **Deployments**:
  - A higher-level abstraction that manages Pods and ReplicaSets.
  - Ensures the desired number of Pods are running and up-to-date.

---

### Deployment vs ReplicaSet vs Pod

- **Pod**:
  - Basic unit of deployment. Not ideal for long-term management (no healing, no scaling).

- **ReplicaSet**:
  - Ensures a specified number of identical Pods are running.
  - Does not handle rollouts or rollbacks.

- **Deployment**:
  - Manages ReplicaSets and allows declarative updates.
  - Supports rollouts, rollbacks, scaling, and self-healing.

---

## ⚙️ Kubernetes Controllers

- **Controller**:
  - A loop that watches the state of the cluster and makes changes to meet the desired state.

- **ReplicaSet Controller**:
  - Ensures the specified number of pod replicas are running.
  - Handles **auto-healing** by replacing failed or terminated pods.

## 📦 Commands Practiced

```bash
kubectl get all
```
- Lists all resources (pods, services, deployments, etc.) in the current namespace.

```bash
kubectl get all -A
```
- Lists all resources in all namespaces.

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
```
- Applies a configuration to a resource. 
- **Declarative**: Updates if exists, creates if not.
- Preferred over `create` for repeated usage.

```bash
kubectl create -f pod.yaml
```
- **Imperative**: Will error out if the resource already exists.

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
- Creates or updates a deployment configuration.

```bash
kubectl get pods -w
```
- Watches for changes to pods in real time.

---

## 📁 Why use `deployment.yaml` instead of `pod.yaml`

- `deployment.yaml`:
  - Manages replicas, rollouts, and restarts.
  - Supports updates and rollbacks.
  - Automatically replaces failed pods.
- `pod.yaml`:
  - One-time, unmanaged pod definition. Not scalable or resilient.

## 📄 Example Deployment YAML for Nginx

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## ⚙️ Real-time working of a deployment - Deleting a pod

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
- Creates pod and deployment
```bash
$ kubectl get deploy

NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           16s

```

```bash
$ kubectl get pods  

NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE  
nginx-deployment-647677fc66-cx4h5   1/1     Running   0          6s  
nginx-deployment-647677fc66-tb6sf   1/1     Running   0          47s  
nginx-deployment-647677fc66-zkt66   1/1     Running   0          47s
```

```bash
$ kubectl delete pod nginx-deployment-647677fc66-cx4h5

pod "nginx-deployment-647677fc66-cx4h5" deleted
```

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -w

NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

- Practiced declarative (`apply`) and imperative (`create`) commands.
- Learned why `deployment.yaml` is the standard for production-grade workloads.
- Monitored live changes to pods using `kubectl get pods -w`.
